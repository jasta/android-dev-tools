What is this?
-------------

This is a set of scripts to enhance and filter Android's logcat output.

Usually you'll want to run:

`./super-logcat.sh <interesting-process-name-regex>`

So, if your process name is `com.example.myapp`, then running `./super-logcat.sh example` will show all messages related to your application.

Running the `super-logcat.sh` script with no arguments will display the logcat output from every process, piped through the same formatting and coloring algorithm.
